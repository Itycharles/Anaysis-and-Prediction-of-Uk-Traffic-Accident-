# Anaysis-and-Prediction-of-Uk-Traffic-Accident-
Anaysis and Prediction of Uk  Traffic Accident 
Project Background Information.
All road traffic accidents involving casualties are logged and reported in the United Kingdom, along with (probably) a majority of other non-fatal road traffic accidents. Every year, the government releases a large batch of data associated with these reports. In this assignment we will be using the data from 2019 as it represents a very complete sample with a lot of ancillary data available. We have uploaded the relevant data to Canvas and it contains the following files:

(1)	Brief-guide-to road-accidents-and-safety-data. This file contains a very short introduction to the data set produced by the government.
(2)	variable lookup. This spreadsheet details the large amount of variables present in each of the datasets. 
(3)	Road Safety Data - Accidents 2019. This spreadsheet contains the details of the accidents logged in 2019.
(4)	Road Safety Data - Casualties 2019. This spreadsheet details the casualties contained in the logged accidents.
(5)	Road Safety Data- Vehicles 2019. This spreadsheet contains the details of the vehicles involved in the accidents. 
(6)	Adjustment Files. These files contain government modelling for the probabilities of different injuries occurring for each accident.
(i)	adjustment figure guidance. This provides a short amount of government guidance on the figures included. 
(ii)	cas_adjustment_lookup_2019. This spreadsheet contains the tabulated adjusted probabilities of injuries. 

Please note: some of these files are simply too large to open even within excel. Therefore, it will be necessary to undertake analysis within Python. 

The Task.
Imagine that you are a data scientist confronted with this data (this is not far from the truth!). Your task is to advise government agencies about how to improve road safety and create a model that would predict such accidents and the injuries that they incur. 

Importantly, we will be using time within our workshops to help with this assignment, and it doesnâ€™t have to be all completed at once. 









The questions (at minimum) that the assignment should address are as follows:
(a)	Are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur?
(b)	For motorbikes, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur?
(c)	For pedestrians involved in accidents, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which they are more likely to be involved?
(d)	What impact, if any, does daylight savings have on road traffic accidents in the week after it starts and stops?
(e)	What impact, if any, does sunrise and sunset times have on road traffic accidents?
(f)	Are there particular types of vehicles (engine capacity, age of vehicle, etc.) that are more frequently involved in road traffic accidents?
(g)	Are there particular conditions (weather, geographic location, situations) that generate more road traffic accidents?
(h)	How does driver related variables affect the outcome (e.g., age of the driver, and the purpose of the journey)?
(i)	Can we make predictions about when and where accidents will occur, and the severity of the injuries sustained from the data supplied to improve road safety? How well do our models compare to government models? 

Your Report.
Please structure your report as follows.
(a)	Short introduction. No more than a few sentences introducing the dataset and the problems that you seek to solve using it.
(b)	Analysis. Present an analysis of the data, including any visualizations, that address the questions (a)-(h), above. This should be broken down in to analysing when, where, and under what conditions accidents happen, as per the questions above.
(c)	Predictions. This should be a working model to address point (i), above, that can predict the conditions under which accidents are most likely to occur in, and the severity of injuries sustained given the conditions they happen under.
(d)	Recommendations. What recommendations can be made to government agencies based on this data and your analysis to improve safety? Keep this to your top 4 or 5 bullet points.
